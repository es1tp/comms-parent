Decibel (symbol dB) is a decimal logarithmic unit of measurement that expresses the ratio of two physical
quantities (often power or voltage) or the level of one quantity compared to some
reference or base quantity. The decibel is a subunit of the Bel, 1B = 10 dB.

Since it expresses the ratio of two quantities whose units are the same, the decibel is
a dimensionless quantity. Decibels are used to measure, for example, sound pressure level, electrical signal
amplification or attenuation, etc.

The advantage of this unit is the simple representation of very large and very small ratios,
which is due to the logarithmic scale. This allows us, for example, to describe very large and very small
signal level ratios easily and comprehensibly without using annoyingly long numbers.

The calculation formulas for Bels are different depending on whether we are dealing with energy quantities
such as energy, power, sound intensity, or field quantities
(amplitudes), such as electric field strength, electric voltage, current intensity, sound pressure.

For energy units, N (dB) = 10 * lg (P1/P2) and for field units
N (dB) = 20 * lg (F1/F2) where P1 or F1 is the predetermined
base value.

Some frequently used dB values:

| dB | Power ratio | Amplitude ratio |
|----|----------------|-------------------|
| 60 | 1000000 | 1000 |
| 40 | 10000 | 100 |
| 20 | 100 | 10 |
| 10 | 10  | 3.162 |
| 6 | 3.981 ≈ 4 | 1.995 ≈ 2 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| -3 | 0.501 ≈ 1⁄2 | 0.708 |
| −6 | 0.251 ≈ 1⁄4 | 0.501 ≈ 1⁄2 |
| −10 |	0.1 | 0.3162 |
| −20| 0.01 | 0.1 |
| −40 |	0.0001| 0.01 |
|−60 | 0.000001|0.001 |

For example, -3 dB signal loss in a coaxial cable means that half of the transmitter's
output power is lost in the cable. A ten-fold increase in transmission power
means a +10dB change, but a +20dB change already means a hundred-fold
increase in transmission power.

On receiver S-meter scales, each step generally means a 6dB change,
so going from S8 to S9 means a four-fold increase in power or a
two-fold increase in signal voltage coming from the antenna.

1 dB is the smallest change in sound loudness that the ear can distinguish. This is possible
only under ideal conditions when a person listens to a "pure" tone at a medium constant
frequency and there are no other noises around them. It has been agreed
that under normal conditions, a healthy ear can barely perceive a 3-decibel sound change.

Suffixes are added to the decibel symbol to refer to the base level
with which the measured value is compared.

The dBm (dBmW) used in electrical engineering expresses signal amplification or attenuation
relative to 1 milliwatt, which is the base value or zero level (0 dB). So when it is said that
signal strength is −63 dBm, this is the same as saying that this signal is 63 decibels
weaker than a 1-milliwatt signal. When it is said that a transmitter's
output power is 40 dBm, this means that the output power is 10000 mW
or 10W.

In studio technology, the familiar symbol dBu is known – signal voltage ratio relative to 0.775 volts,
in home audio technology, dBV is used - signal voltage ratio relative to 1 volt.
