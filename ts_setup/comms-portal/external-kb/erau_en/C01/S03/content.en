Ohm's law defines the relationship between voltage U, current intensity I and resistance R:

U=I*R or I=U/R or R=U*I

I is the intensity of current flowing through the circuit section, measured in amperes (A);
U is voltage, measured in volts (V);
R is the resistance of the circuit section, measured in ohms (Î©).

For alternating current, the relationship applies

I=U/Z

where Z is the apparent resistance of the AC circuit.

Power is closely related to Ohm's law and can be calculated:

P = U * I = I * I * R = U * U * R
