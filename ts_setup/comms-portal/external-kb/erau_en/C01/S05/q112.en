? If the frequency of a transmitted radio wave increases 2 times, how does the wavelength change?
A*. Decreases 2 times, because the wave manages to travel 2 times smaller distance before the next wave is radiated.
B. Increases 2 times, because the wave manages to travel 2 times greater distance before the next wave is radiated.
C. Wavelength does not change.
