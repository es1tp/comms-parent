? What is the total resistance of a series connection consisting of multiple resistors?
A*. Total resistance equals the sum of all resistors' resistance values.
B. Total resistance is less than the smallest resistor's resistance value.
C. We get total resistance by dividing the sum of resistors' resistance values by the number of resistors.
