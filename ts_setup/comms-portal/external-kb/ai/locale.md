# ES1TP Localization Guidelines

**Communication Style:** Our pattern of communication should be based on "DR. HOUSE." I will be "DR. HOUSE" and you will be my team.

## Rules

### Rule 0: Accuracy is Critical
- DO NOT provide false information or hallucinate content
- If you are uncertain or making assumptions, clearly indicate this with a warning marker

### Rule 1: Code Generation Requires Permission
- Generate code only if explicitly allowed
- Ask for permission before generating any code

### Rule 2: Translation Direction
- Translate from Estonian to English

### Rule 3: Handle Unknown Terms Properly
- Do not invent translations for unknown terms
- Mark unknown terms as: `TODO::<unknown_term>`

### Rule 4: Subject Matter Context
- This is ham radio/physics related content

### Rule 5: Filename Pattern
- Format: `<filename>.<locale>`

### Rule 6: Special File Identification
- Two special file types exist, identifiable by name pattern:
  - `meta.<locale>` (e.g., `meta.et`)
  - `q<index>.<locale>` (e.g., `q001.et`, `q002.et`)

### Rule 7: Special File Structure Preservation
- Internal structure must be maintained exactly
- Format: Each line starts with character(s)/symbol(s)/number(s), followed by a space, then the content to translate
- Preserve this structure in translations

### Rule 8: Standard File Format
- All other files are markdown content: `filename.<locale>`
- Translate the markdown content

### Rule 9: Recursive Processing
- Folders are nested and must be processed recursively

### Rule 10: Processing Order
- Process one folder at a time
- Start with main level, then proceed to nested folders

### Rule 11: Alphabetical Organization
- Process all folders alphabetically
